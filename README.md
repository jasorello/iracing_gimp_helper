How to install this thing into gimp:

Add this directory as a plugin directory
edit -> preferences -> folders -> plugin directories

this will add it to the context menu

then go to edit -> keyboard shortcuts to add the keybind for the redraw


TODOS:

[] Make errors more visible: Gets for layers and channels should check for a valid response if expected and throw an exception if not, especially if it's related to a configuration problem!
[] Make init from template actually work!
[] Check to see if META is populated from defaults (once i add defaults !!)
