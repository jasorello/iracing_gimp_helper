How to install this thing into gimp:

Add this directory as a plugin directory
edit -> preferences -> folders -> plugin directories

this will add it to the context menu

You can initialize an iracing template using the initialize function added to tools -> iracing ->initialize-from-template

And once you've made updates to the META group to change the layers to include the correct path for your car as well as your iracing id, you can run the export-to-iracing command to automatically export.

then go to edit -> keyboard shortcuts to add the keybind for the export-to-iracing command
